# Minimalistic Kernel for Raspberry Pi

This repository contains a minimalistic kernel built from scratch for the Raspberry Pi. The kernel features a command-line interface (CLI), dynamic memory allocation, and Caesar Cipher functionalities.

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A simple interface that allows user interaction with the kernel.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Implemented basic memory management and dynamic allocation.
- **Caesar Cipher:** An encryption utility to demonstrate basic algorithm implementation within the kernel.

## Project Overview

The project was an educational exercise focused on understanding the fundamental principles of operating systems. It emphasizes low-level programming and systems concepts such as memory management, process control, and basic encryption algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **C:** Core language for the kernel development.
- **Raspberry Pi:** Target hardware for deploying and testing the kernel.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RKPen/Kernel.git
2. Follow the setup instructions in the docs/ directory to load the kernel onto your Raspberry Pi.


Usage

Once the kernel is running, you can interact with it via the CLI and explore its functionalities like dynamic memory management and encryption with the Caesar Cipher.
Future Enhancements

    Expand the CLI to support more commands.
    Improve memory management techniques.
    Implement additional encryption algorithms.
